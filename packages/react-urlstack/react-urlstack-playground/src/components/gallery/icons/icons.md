Icons in these galleries are the one shipped by the amazing [react-native-vector-icons](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons) library.

They already works in react-native and react-native-web and can be used by importing `components/icons/AntDesign` for example.

To make the icon usage simpler, there is an [Icon](#icon) component under the UI section that makes a shortcut to one of these libraries.
